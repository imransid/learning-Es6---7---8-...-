Coding Break: Operating and Destructuring

We made it to the end of this section, and now we can take a short break (remember these are optional)!

Let’s take a moment to review the important material we just learned.

    The es6 spread operator spreads the contents of an array or object into multiple variables. Its syntax uses three periods, just like so: …

    Destructuring Assignment  in es6 allows us to extract data from arrays or objects into separate, distinct variables.

    Array Destructuring Assignment assigns multiple variables from an array. For instance, let [a, b] = c, where values ‘a’ and ‘b’ assign in order to the respective elements in ‘c’.

    Object Destructuring Assignment assigns multiple variables form an object. For instance, let { a, b } = c, where values ‘a’ and ‘b’ assign to the ‘a’ and ‘b’ properties in ‘c’.

Overall, the spread and operator and destructuring assignment will significantly reduce the length of your JavaScript code. Sometimes, using the spread operators and destructuring assignment techniques really feels like coding magic!

What do you call a professional that fixes engines?

A machine operator.

How about someone who fixes telephones?

A telephone operator, of course.

How about someone who fixes butter and jam?

Why, that’s a …spread operator.
